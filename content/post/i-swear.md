I swear I miss you

The magical nights

The 3 AM fights

The promises of life

I swear, Oh, I swear

I still miss you



High octane days

My octave maze

You were the guide

Fighting my odds

More like a torch

I swear, Oh, I swear

I still miss you



Then the darker days

The world’s odds

I don’t know why

Why you leave me

I swear, Oh, I swear

I still miss you



Still I wonder

Promises of life

I will be there

Will you still?

I swear I miss you

Please come.
