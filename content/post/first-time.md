The first time

I saw you

You had my sight

Withheld by might

And then you smile

That first time

<br><br>

I wondered why

If anytime

Will you talk?

Will you walk?

Beside me

For first time

<br><br>

The chain of

Attraction

Losing our

Traction

Were you

Mine?

That first time

<br><br>

You wipe my

Tears

Forgiving my fears

I ain’t feeble

It’s just the past

And you understood

That first time

<br><br>

Walking the dangers

Fearing the strangers

Please don’t shy

I remember thy

I still love you

From first time

<br><br>

Asking you out

That weird shout

You gave me

I rave you

Magic

My first time

<br><br>

More than

Friends

I believe

We were

But you refuse

Breaking my heart

For first time

<br><br>

But still

I accept it

Anyhow

Still better

My first time
