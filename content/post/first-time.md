The first time

I saw you

You had my sight

Withheld by might

And then you smile

That first time



I wondered why

If anytime

Will you talk?

Will you walk?

Beside me

For first time



The chain of

Attraction

Losing our

Traction

Were you

Mine?

That first time



You wipe my

Tears

Forgiving my fears

I ain’t feeble

It’s just the past

And you understood

That first time



Walking the dangers

Fearing the strangers

Please don’t shy

I remember thy

I still love you

From first time



Asking you out

That weird shout

You gave me

I rave you

Magic

My first time



More than

Friends

I believe

We were

But you refuse

Breaking my heart

For first time



But still

I accept it

Anyhow

Still better

My first time
