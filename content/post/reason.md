Dear reason

I was a bully

A sadist

You were a magic

A beauty



Dear reason

I was quiet

Hiding things

Un-notified pings

You were might

Morphed me

Oh, reason



Life was history

Love: uncovered mystery

Hidden wisdoms

Unspoken kingdoms

Entered thy

Morphing my

Oh, reason



Dear reason

I am a supporter

A lover

You changed me

Wow, reason



Dear reason

Neglected things

Now magical

Imagination wings

Euphoria

Beautiful now

You helped me

Oh, reason



Pondering thoughts

Words I wrote

Were you Atlantis?

Oh, love

Please speak.
