I recall

You did the talks

Mystical walks

Withholding me

Imaginary?

<br><br>

You were shy

My heart’s pie

Living me softly

Sans efforts

Imaginary?

<br><br>

I was worn

Heavenly light

I was blessed

I lived

Imaginary?

<br><br>

That’s history

More like mystery

Unwept thoughts

Remind me

You were there

Imaginery.
