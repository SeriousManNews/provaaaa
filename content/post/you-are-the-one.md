You are the one

Oh, the reason for smile

Love in the Californian drive

The soul of my emptiness

You are the one

Yeah, you are the one

<br><br>

You bring me to life

Hope in the darkness

For let the sunshine

Removing the clouds

Uplifting my soul

You are the one

Yeah, you are the one

<br><br>

Counting the stars

Those silly nights

The petty fights

The empty minds

You are the one

Yeah, you are the one

<br><br>

You take me high

I donâ€™t know why

But you are the one

Yeah, you are the one

Please stay.
